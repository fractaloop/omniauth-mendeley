# DEPRECATED

Mendeley has migrated from OAuth 1 to OAuth 2. As a result, this gem is no longer supported. Please use [hedgesky/omniauth-mendeley](https://github.com/hedgesky/omniauth-mendeley) in the future.

# OmniAuth Mendeley

This is the unofficial OmniAuth strategy for authenticating to Mendeley. To
use it, you'll need to sign up for an OAuth Application ID and Secret
on the [Mendeley Applications Page](https://dev.mendeley.com/applications/register/).

## Basic Usage

    use OmniAuth::Builder do
      provider :mendeley, ENV['MENDELEY_KEY'], ENV['MENDELEY_SECRET']
    end
